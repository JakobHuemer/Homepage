          <p class="description">
            I began playing table tennis in the club when I was about 8 years
            old. It's a fun sport for me because it requires precision and
            doesn't require much movement. Because of school and my location, I
            don't have time to go to the club and play anymore. But even though
            I don't play as often as I used to, I still love table tennis. It's
            a great way to improve my hand-eye coordination and it's fun to play
            with friends or family. I also like that it's a low-impact sport.
            Overall, it's a great hobby for me. It's fun, challenging, and
            rewarding.

          <h1 class="name">Programming</h1>
          <p class="description">
            I began with programming about 2 years ago, starting with Javascript
            and developing a discord bot. It was challenging for me because it
            was my first time ever programming, and I didn't understand the
            logic of it. I followed tutorials on YouTube and just did what I was
            told, but I eventually took a break from Javascript.
            <br />
            After a while, I started to understand how programming works and
            began coding on my own for my bot. I also tried my hand at creating
            a website. I also used Python to make discord bots, but I didn't
            enjoy it as much as Javascript. I found Python to be an easy
            language to understand and use for creating small programs that help
            automate tasks.
            <br />
            Now, I want to make programming my career and am learning Java, CSS,
            HTML, and Windows shell in school. Next year, I will also be
            learning Javascript, and I plan to continue learning and improving
            my skills to make programming my job.

          <p class="description">
            I've been gaming my whole life. My favorite games are Minecraft and
            Dead by Daylight. I also played some Valorant, but first-person
            shooter games aren't really my thing. I prefer casual games like
            Minecraft or games that I can play with friends and have fun, like
            Dead by Daylight. I also enjoy playing puzzle platform games like
            Hourglass, Stray, and Portal.
            <br />
            I love the creativity and freedom that games like Minecraft offer. I
            can build and explore to my heart's content, and there's always
            something new to discover. Dead by Daylight is also a lot of fun
            because it's a multiplayer game and I can play with my friends. It's
            always exciting to try to outsmart the other players and come up
            with new strategies.
            <br />
            Puzzle platform games like Hourglass, Stray, and Portal are also a
            lot of fun for me because they challenge my problem-solving skills
            and keep me on my toes. I enjoy figuring out the solutions to the
            puzzles and making my way through the levels.
            <br />
            Overall, gaming is a great hobby for me because it allows me to
            relax and have fun. It's also a great way to socialize with friends
            and family, and I enjoy the challenge of trying to improve my skills
            and beat new levels or challenges.
