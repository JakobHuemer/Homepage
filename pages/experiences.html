          I first learned Java in my software development class this year. Since
          then, I have gained experience working with Strings, loops, and more
          complex logic, such as building a tax calculator. In the future, I
          hope to continue learning and improving my skills in Java so that I
          can create high-quality, efficient software that people can use and
          benefit from.

        <p class="experience">
          I first began working with JavaScript and Node.js about a year and a
          half ago, when I started building a Discord bot. Over time, I
          continued to develop and improve my bot, and I also started using
          JavaScript in my own portfolio. My skills in these languages include
          editing complex Strings, working with JSON files, making HTTP
          requests, and using the Discord.js library. I am always looking to
          learn more and improve my skills, and I am excited to continue
          exploring the possibilities of these languages in the future.

        <p class="experience">
          After using JavaScript, I decided to try Python and quickly became
          comfortable with it. I enjoyed the clean, concise formatting of the
          code and the fact that it doesn't require brackets. I also built a
          Discord bot with nextcord.py, but it wasn't as advanced as discord.js
          and was somewhat confusing and labor-intensive. I have also gained
          experience with the tkinter package, using it to create a calculator.
          Currently, I am learning pygame in order to build user interfaces and
          enhance my everyday life with Python. In the future, I plan to
          continue learning and exploring the power and potential of Python, as
          it is a popular and in-demand language for job opportunities and
          earning income.

        <p class="experience">
          I first started learning HTML and CSS about two years ago. HTML was
          relatively easy for me to understand, but CSS was somewhat more
          challenging, as I wasn't familiar with all of its rules and features.
          Despite this, I was able to create simple websites with a basic
          structure using these languages. In the future, I plan to continue
          learning and improving my skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
          potentially PHP, as I am interested in pursuing web development as a
          career. My main focus will be on improving my front-end skills,
          particularly in the area of design, as this is currently my weakest
          area.
